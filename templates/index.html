            <h2>About Me & My Research</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my interactive portfolio. I am looking for opportunities to design and influence future interactions with AI and LLMs. I achieved a master degree in Human Computer Interaction in 2025. For the past few years, I've been absolutely captivated by the world of AI and LLM interactions. How make them as useful, accessible, and visible as possible for users! 
               What novel areas to explore, such as deploying them on live streaming sites to let viewers interact with them, facilitating new opportunities for creative engagements. Therefore I created this site to showcase and update and link recent projects and ideas. 
               Ask the LLM currently supported with RAG about my projects and scientifc work or check my CV and other information.</p>

                                Games to mediate collaborative storytelling on Twitch, addressing the lack of
                                frameworks for equitable multi-user prompting. A mixed-methods approach
                                is used to evaluate the LLM as a game agent and record the user experience.
                                This approach combines qualitative interviews, game expereince questionnaire
                                surveys, and exact match analysis. This process is supposed to provide in
                                sights that contribute to a better understanding of the user experience when
                                LLMs/GPTs are integrated into gaming contexts. The findings indicate that,
                                while the used LLM (Qwq) effectively merged numerous inputs into a cohesive
                                narrative, it exhibited an "early-input bias," preferring initial contributions
                                and thereby compromising inclusivity in later turns. This resulted in a decrease of more than 50 percent in the EM score by the fifth turn. Participants
                                reported moderate engagement and low perceived competence, suggesting deficiencies in user experience design concerning visibility and feedback. Positively
                                there was next to no tension and frustrations recorded. Mutual influence while
                                prompting the LLM to create the narrative received moderate ratings, indi
                                cating a moderate impact. Additionally, the LLM‚Äôs adherence to more than
                                human perspectives was noted as inconsistent with anthropocentric framing
                                appearing in a few occasions. However, humor increased enjoyment and was
                                partially successful combined with critiques of human ecological impact. Over
                                all, the study is able to contribute to human-AI collaboration in multi-user
                                contexts, but the LLM instructed as a game agent is not able to fulfill the
                                task sufficiently all the time. Due to limitations such as small sample sizes
                                and reliance on prompts to facilitate the agent, the thesis explores more the
                                feasibility of creating narrations with users remotely providing multiple inputs
                                in a prompt.

                                In particular, we compare three different prompt strategies: dog-centred perspective, an anthropocentric-debiased perspective, and a control without any bias. The outputs were evaluated against three baseline
                                data sources: Video analyses of dog behavior, interviews with dog owners, and interviews with canine behavior experts.
                                Findings suggest that the default prompt produced the most anthropocentric responses, while the anthropocentric-debiased prompt aligned more closely with expert perspectives. The dog-centric prompt, though aiming for a canine viewpoint, often anthropomorphized dogs through human-like language.

                                time abroad, the study examines various aspects of PT use,

                                improve the usability and effectiveness of public transport. 
                                Recommendations include the adoption of contactless payment 
                                methods, the introduction of express services, and the expansion of 
                                PT coverage in underserved areas with alternative PT modes. 
                                Further research is recommended to explore additional or more

                                In an other future project I will target developing a gaming experience in which a GEN is used to create live new contents such as bosses in a video game based on the viewers input.

                                    end.
                                    The goal of the game is to educate the average internet user on the dangers
                                    of social engineering and the techniques used by attackers to access someone‚Äôs
                                    personal data. The game is designed such that the player takes on the role of
                                    the attacker, slowly uncovering a political scandal. The player is asked to gather
                                    information on parties involved such as companies and politicians. The story
                                    progresses until the scandal is revealed.
                                    By providing a choice for different actions, players learn more about different
                                    social engineering techniques, making them more aware of its dangers and possibly spread awareness by sharing this knowledge with their social environment.
                                    This can be seen as an additional goal, extending and supporting employee
                                    education in the public and private sector on privacy and security measures,
                                    possibly outperforming other mediums such as educational videos.
                                    For the prototype, the story, graphics and programming mini-games were implemented to make the game both educational and fun. At the current state, the
                                    story is developed until level 4. The game engine used for development is Ren‚ÄôPy,
                                    and the code can be found on GitHub.
                                    The game is mainly story based with the player being able to choose actions
                                    to take next. Some of those options will definitely lead to the access of information, some won‚Äôt and could perhaps lead to the player getting caught. This
                                    means that the game creates a tree of choices for the player to make with some
                                    branches leading to a positive and some to a negative outcome.

                            <p> In our data-driven society, data representation is a crucial problem that affects
                                decision-making in many different sectors. This project examines the need for the
                                physicalization of abstract data using inflatables in order to make it more accessible and
                                palpable. Our project aims to allow users to build their usual meal and see how it meets the
                                proposed standards. Also, the user is given the opportunity to change their choice in the
                                process by removing or adding certain products, which helps them think about possible
                                changes in their diet and makes their further choice more conscious.
                                In our case, inflatables act as a pneumatic system that pushes out the table legs at
                                indicators above or below the norm, which makes it possible to clearly see the result of their
                                choices. The table's four inflated components, which correlate to important nutritional
                                indicators and dynamically display meal balance, provide a useful and memorable way to
                                comprehend dietary choices.

                                of "Air-Balanced Bites," an interactive dining table that physically depicts the nutritional
                                balance of meals in real time. In this TEAM-project my tasks and contributions were mostly about ideation,
                                prototyping and building of the final version, while my team mates were more concerned with programming and the design</p>

                                <p>Autonomous driving and the vision of a safe, efficient and convenient
                                    mobility concept still have a few hurdles to overcome, but are steadily making their way
                                    into our everyday lives (Sokolov, 2015). As reported by Der Spiegel, the behavior and functionality of autonomous vehicles in
                                    city traffic is already being tested on a
                                    test track in Hamburg (cfr, 2019).
                                    Semi-autonomous systems (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) such as
                                    lane departure warning systems in cars and trucks are just one example of the advanced technology in the
                                    mobility sector. Over the last 40 years, systems such as anti-lock braking
                                    system (ABS), electronic stability program (ESP) and adaptive cruise control (ACC) have become established,
                                    which initially support the driver in the longitudinal and increasingly also in the lateral guidance of the
                                    vehicle (Beiker, 2015, p. 200; Johanning, Mildner, 2015, p. 61).
                                    The underlying scenario of autonomous level four is that the driver remains capable of driving at all times
                                    and takes control of the vehicle
                                    in the event of an unexpected situation. For this reason, the following question is investigated in this thesis in a
                                    study using a driving simulator: Which signal enables a safe and
                                    reliable transfer of control of the vehicle, even if the driver is no longer in the ‚Äúloop‚Äù due to another
                                    activity? This means that the driver is no longer actively participating in the
                                    driving process.
                                    The vibration signal and the acoustic signal for the ‚Äútake over request‚Äù
                                    are examined on the basis of an evaluation of reaction times and the deviation from the
                                    route traveled. In addition, a preference of the test person is determined with a subsequent questionnaire.
                                    Finally, the results are presented and a recommendation for future
                                    studies is made.</p>
